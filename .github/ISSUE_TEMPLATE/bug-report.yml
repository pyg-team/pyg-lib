      description: |
        Please provide a clear and concise description of the bug.

        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for the snippet to be as minimal as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently. We are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you did: avoid any external data, and include the relevant imports:

        ```python
        # All necessary imports at the beginning
        import torch
        import pyg_lib

        # A minimal reproducing example trimmed down to the essential parts:
        ...
        ```

        Please also paste or describe the results you observe instead of the expected results. If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the **full** traceback of the exception. It may be relevant to wrap error messages in ```` ```triple quotes blocks``` ````.
