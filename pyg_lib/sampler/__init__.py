    r"""Samples random walks of length :obj:`walk_length` from all node
    indices in :obj:`seed` in the graph given by :obj:`(rowptr, col)`, as
    described in the `"node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653>`_ paper.

    Args:
        rowptr (torch.Tensor): Compressed source node indices.
        col (torch.Tensor): Target node indices.
        seed (torch.Tensor): Seed node indices from where random walks start.
        walk_length (int): The walk length of a random walk.
        p (float, optional): Likelihood of immediately revisiting a node in the
            walk. (default: :obj:`1.0`)
        q (float, optional): Control parameter to interpolate between
            breadth-first strategy and depth-first strategy.
            (default: :obj:`1.0`)

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape :obj:`[seed.size(0), walk_length + 1]`
        holding the nodes indices of each walk for each seed node.
